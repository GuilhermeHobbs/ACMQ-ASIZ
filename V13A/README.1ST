Installation:

To install, simply copy all the files to the same directory, an run the
programs from there.
Set the DOS variable TPBGI to the path were the .BGI and .CHR files are.
Ex: type at the DOS prompt, or put in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file a line as:
set tpbgi=c:\asiz
If this is not done, the program ASIZ-P will not find the graphics drivers.
