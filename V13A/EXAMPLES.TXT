          Euler inte-grators. Value list: BP610.VAL. From: A. C. 
          M.  de Queiroz and P. M.  Pinheiro,  "Switched-current 
          ladder  band-pass  filters", Proc.  1994  IEEE  ISCAS, 
          London, UK, pp. 309-312, May 1994.

     Most  of the examples include formulas for the element  va-
lues in the .CIR file. The EdFil program evaluates these  formu-
las to obtain the final element values for the netlist file.  To 
design a different filter, it is enough to change the .VAL  file 
read  by  the EdFil program as a value list and  regenerate  the 
netlist  file. The value lists included are element  values  for 
passive LC doubly terminated ladder filters.
     The examples of Chebyshev filters illustrate possible  pro-
blems in finding multiple transmission zeros.
     The  output  node for all the SI filters is 1. In  all  the 
examples the correct transfer function is obtained with  impulse 
sampling.
